# Become A Musician

## Phase 1 - *Proposal*

This application is designed to help users with memorizing chords/scales. This educational app is
for anyone who is willing to study music theory. Users can create a character and level them up by earning points for
each chord (scale to be added in the later version) they have memorized.
