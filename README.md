# Ji Young's CPSC 210 Project

## Phase 1 - *Proposal*

This application is designed to help users with memorizing chords/scales and with ear training. This educational app is
for anyone who is willing to study music theory. Users can create characters and level them up by earning points for
each chord/scale they have memorized. The characters can take RCM exams when they are ready. Will the character(s) be
able to pass the exams? It's up to **you**!
